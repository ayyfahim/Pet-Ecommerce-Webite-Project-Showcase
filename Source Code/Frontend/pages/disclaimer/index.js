              If you’ve never been through dog training, it’s helpful to know how it works before you sign up. You’ll
              learn what to expect with each class and be able to continue following the proper training principles at
              home.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Petco-certified Positive Dog Trainers at Petco abide by a science-based, positive reinforcement
              dog-training philosophy. This means that training classes follow rewards-based, fun and effective methods
              to instill positive behaviors and that appeal to your dog. Training focuses on rewarding dogs for doing
              things correctly, making them more likely to repeat those behaviors, while dissuading negative behaviors
              through management and refocusing tactics. Positive reinforcement training has been proven effective in
              not only training any type learner but also in building a strong bond between pet parents and their dogs.
